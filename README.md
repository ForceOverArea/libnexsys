# `libnexsys` - The C++ Nexsys distribution

Normally, Nexsys is Rust-written. One of the goals of Nexsys is for it to be available on multiple platforms, even as a source distribution. This way, anyone can tweak it to their needs or add features as desired on-the-fly. As such, with C++ being more common in work environments than rust, this repository offers a way to compile and edit the Nexsys equation solver in those environments.
